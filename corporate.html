 <!--Part 1: the founder-->
                    <p>The co-founder of Sony, Masaru Ibuka was disappointed he couldn’t bring a cassette player with him on long, transatlantic plane rides. He asked engineers  to  develop a device that was small enough to carry around while allowing the user to listen to whatever he or she wanted. Therefore Msaru and his partner Kozo Oshone decided to create something portable and gave their developers a time frame. </p>
                    <p>Under a time crunch Sony developers took created the Pressman—a bulky recorder meant for a niche market—and removed the recording mechanism, adding a lightweight pair of headphones and a stereo amplifier.</p>

                    <p>Morita took their modified Pressman home and listened to it. It was exactly what he and Ibuka wanted, with one exception: His wife was annoyed at the isolating nature of the device. Morita didn’t want Sony to market a “rude” product, so he had his team add a second headphone jack and an orange button that allowed two listeners to talk to each other through a microphone.</p>
                    <p>On July 1, 1979 the Walkman was announced to the public.  The Walkman had a major influence on 1980s culture.[ Over 400 millions Walkmans to be sold in the coming decades; enough for Sony’s profits to grow so substantially that they could afford to buy a movie studio, Columbia Pictures; enough that city officials would declare them a public nuisance that could result in deadly traffic accidents or ear damage.</p>
