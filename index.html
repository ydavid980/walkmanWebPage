                <h2>The Sony Walkman turns 40 years old</h2>
                <p> Sony brought out its first Walkman, the TPS-L2, in Japan on July 1, 1979. The very first portable audio cassette player allowed its user to privately enjoy music through headphones plugged directly into the unit. This was revolutionary, and it soon won over the world. Only in 2010, however, did Sony cease production of its cassette Walkman. Since then, Sony has continued to sell its Walkman line in the form of high-fidelity players. In honour of this birthday boy, we be to releasing 100,000 limited units. Pre-ordering phase of the TPS-L2 will begin soon.<br/><br/><a href ="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/the-sony-walkman-is-40-years-old-1.4488906" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
